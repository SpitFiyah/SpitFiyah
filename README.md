## 🚀 About Me

Aspiring software developer, caffeine-dependent lifeform, and eternal bug hunter.  
Currently on a quest to master code (and occasionally, my own sleep schedule).

**Other Interests:**  
♟️ Chess enthusiast — trying to master the Sicilian Defense (or at least spell it right)  
📚 Philosophy enthusiast — because who doesn’t enjoy a good existential crisis with their morning coffee?

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools

- Python 🐍 (sometimes bites)
- Java ☕ (keeps me awake)
- C (soon… if I survive)
